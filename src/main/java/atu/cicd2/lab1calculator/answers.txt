b)  Is the above exercise using @RequestParam or @PathVariables?
    The exercise is using @RequestParam. I know this because the CalculatorController
    class extracts values from the query string and not the URI path.

c)  Which would be correct to use for this example? Why?
    There are pros and cons to using either.
      * When using @PathVariables we ensure that the client enters a value for each parameter.
        A downside would be that the URI does not clearly state which parameter is num1 and
        which is num2, this would result in different values when dividing and subtracting.
      * When using @RequestParams we allow clients to provide parameters in any order, and it
        clearly states which parameter they are setting.
        The downside is that our query parameters are not optional and are necessary to calculate
        the result.
    In this case I believe @PathVariables is correct because it is important that all parameters
    are given a value.
